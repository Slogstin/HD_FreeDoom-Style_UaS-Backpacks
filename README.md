# Description
This Addon changes the sprites for [Ugly as Sin's](https://github.com/caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin) Ammo Pouch and Assault pack to versions that more closely resemble the FreeDoom backpack.

It also changes the Vanilla backpack to the FD one, so this Addon can be used with the ID Doom games.
